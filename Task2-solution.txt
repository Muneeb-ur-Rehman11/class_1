TASK A — DEFECT HUNT

The following defects were identified in the given requirement set. The defects are categorized into inconsistencies, incompleteness, ambiguities, unverifiable requirements, and missing business rules.

1. Inconsistencies (Logical Conflicts)
1.1 R2 vs R3

R2 states that the system shall not allow registration after the deadline.
R3 states that late registration is allowed for 3 days after the deadline.
These two requirements directly contradict each other.

1.2 R5 vs R16

R5 allows course registration even if seats are full.
R16 states that the system shall support waitlisting when seats are full.
If registration is allowed when seats are full, waitlisting becomes meaningless.

1.3 R9 vs R10

R9 states that the system shall prevent schedule conflicts.
R10 allows registration for two courses occurring at the same time if one is online.
R9 does not mention any exception, which creates a conflict.

1.4 R11 vs R12

R11 limits students to 18 credit hours per semester.
R12 allows up to 24 credit hours with advisor approval.
The maximum limit is unclear and not properly defined.

1.5 R13 vs R15

R13 allows students to drop courses until Week 6.
R15 states that the system shall not allow course drops after the deadline.
The term “deadline” is not clearly defined, causing conflict.

1.6 R7 vs R8

R7 prevents registration if prerequisites are not met.
R8 allows prerequisites to be ignored with instructor approval.
The exception handling process is not clearly defined.

2. Incompleteness (Missing Details)
2.1 R1

The type of students eligible for registration is not defined (e.g., active, suspended, alumni).

2.2 R4

The requirement does not specify whether seat availability is updated in real-time.

2.3 R6

The method and timing of sending confirmation are not specified.

2.4 R14

The drop fee amount or calculation method is not defined.

2.5 R16

The maximum capacity of the waitlist is not specified.

2.6 R19

The mechanism for providing priority enrollment to final-year students is not defined.

2.7 R3

The conditions for late registration approval are not defined.

3. Ambiguities
3.1 R20

The phrase “register quickly” is vague and lacks measurable criteria.

3.2 R6

The phrase “send confirmation” is unclear regarding timing and method.

3.3 R15

The term “deadline” is ambiguous and not clearly defined.

4. Unverifiable Requirements
4.1 R20

“Register quickly” cannot be measured or tested without a defined performance metric.

4.2 R6

Without specifying time and medium, confirmation delivery cannot be tested.

5. Missing Business Rules
5.1 Payment Rule Missing

There is no requirement specifying whether registration requires payment confirmation.

5.2 Duplicate Registration Rule Missing

There is no requirement preventing students from registering for the same course multiple times.
